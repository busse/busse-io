I have decided to start a blogging daily in 2017. Ignore that this post is going up on November 28, 2016 - I’m giving myself a bit of a runway to nail the “daily” habit.

I wouldn’t say I’ve been in a creative rut, but I’ve had two interrelated things going on that have made it so that I’m not making the progress in one creative area that I want:

  1. My work, focusing on technology strategy and APIs has become very consuming. I say this in a positive way, because it has lead to a decent amount of professional success for me over the past few years, but it has kind of become a one track thing with regard to most of the content I put out (well, 2009 - 2013 was “social media marketing” and 2013 - present has been and continues to be “APIs”). The one consistent exception to this is my [Instagram account](http://instagram.com/busse), where I’ve maintained decent focus on somewhat interesting photography as a visual diary.

  2. I have a lot of creative output and thought that has never seen the light of day. Most of it is in the area of visual arts, with the majority of that around photography. I’ve been serious about my photography hobby since 1994. However, my focus on my work and professional content has always put that on the back burner. I also continue to make new creative output that I’d like to share more broadly.

This site is my attempt to cure that. Admittedly it isn’t the first time I’ve tried this approach, but I think I have the tools and processes lined up now to make it work. I’ll go more into those areas in future posts, but to start with I want to lay out three points of initial guidance I’ve created for myself:

  1. Publish something here daily - this could range in size from a picture with caption to a long post

  2. Roughly plan the content as: 

      - 80% image-focused, whether it be actual visual content, or meta coverage of image-related things (tools, markets, critiques, etc)

      - 20% not really about visual content - other topics, my process for this site, general opinion pieces, technology, gear & hardware, etc.

  3. Spend about two [Pomodoros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) on each post (with the exception of some longer pieces that I'll break up and work extra on)

I’m excited to see where this leads…
