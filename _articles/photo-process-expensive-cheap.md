Did I rent a $1,500 lens (for $120), to just drop a "Holga-ish" filter on my images in Picasa?

How much of that process matters - the expensive vs. the cheap - ?

Really it's just the feeling evoked by the end results that matters -

What you invest $$$ in the process is kind of BS, although it could be said that the $$ lens lets you create the *input* into your creative process and if you apply a heavily processed filter to it, that is okay.
